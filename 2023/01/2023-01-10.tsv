Gail.com FAQ	https://gail.com/	864	weatherlight	34307705	digraph gail_faq{rankdir=LR;"Q: Why isn't there any content here? Can't you at least throw up a picture of your cat for the Internet to check out?"->"A: Sorry, I have a cat, but she's pretty unexciting by Internet standards. As for why there is very little content here, we wanted to keep the server's attack surface as small as possible to keep it safe.";"Q: Interested in selling gail.com?"->"A: Sorry, no.";"Q: How did you manage to get gail.com?"->"A: My husband registered it as a birthday gift back in 1996.";"Q: How many times a day is this page visited?"->"A: In 2020 this page received a total of 5,950,012 hits, which is an average of 16,257 per day. Looking at just unique hits, we received a total of 1,295,284, for an average of 3,539 unique hits per day. Occasionally, we get Twitter - bombed and may get several tens of thousands of visitors a day. As an example, on July 21st 2020 we received 109,316 hits.";"Q: Why is your website so popular? Are you one of those famous people that no one knows why they're famous?"->"A: No, I'm not famous. It seems likely that most visitors simply mistype gmail.com and end up visiting gail.com by mistake.";"Q: I tried to send some photos to my girlfriend and typed gail.com instead of gmail.com in the address field. The photos were of a _very_ personal nature. Can you please delete them?"->"A: There are only two valid e - mail addresses on the gail.com domain, so it is extremely likely that your photos were rejected by my e - mail provider and deleted. Another interesting gail.com factoid: my amazing e - mail provider, [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), rejects about 1.2 million mis - addressed e - mails per week to the gail.com domain.";"Q: I think you're infringing on my trademark..."->"A: If you consult with someone well versed in trademark law, they will tell you that you can't have an exclusive trademark on a common word or name. My husband and I successfully defended ourselves against an attempted domain takeover in 2006; see [WIPO Case D2006 - 0655](http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2006/d2006 - 0655.html) for more information.";"Q: Are you interested in monetizing gail.com?"->"A: No, but thanks for asking.";"Q: Don't you know that you could throw some ads up and make money?"->"A: Yes, I know, thank you. For those who feel they need more advertising in their life, please have a look at our swanky Electronic Frontier Foundation ad below.
